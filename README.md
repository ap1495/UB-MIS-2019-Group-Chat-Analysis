# Whatsapp-Group-Chat-Analysis

This project is a data visualization exercise and the end goal is to produce interactive plotly visualizations after cleaning up the data.

Data was gathered in the following steps - 
1. Export the raw chat file in .txt format from whatsapp.
2. Import the .txt file to Excel and exclude the first 3 rows in the file.
3. Save it as a .csv file and read it using pandas.
